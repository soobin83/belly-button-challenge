# belly-button-challenge
This is the module 14 challenge, where we were told to "build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels." First, I used D3 library to read the "samples.json" file, and from here, I made a horizontal chart and a bubble chart, as well as a table for a sample metadata. The dropdown menu allows the viewer to select an sample test ID to view key values as well as graphs associated with it.

In the StarterCode folder, and under static.js folder, the two files, app.js and index.html have all the codes. Samples.json was provided for reference.
