# belly-button-challenge
This is the module 14 challenge, where we were told to "build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels." First, I used D3 library to read the "samples.json" file, and from here, I made a horizontal chart and a bubble chart, as well as a table for a sample metadata. The dropdown menu allows the viewer to select a sample test ID to view key values as well as graphs associated with it.

The two files, app.js and index.html are the main files which have all the codes. Samples.json was provided for reference. 

* for some starting codes, I got help from the tutor. Also I received some help from the learning assistant when creating a sample metadata table.
